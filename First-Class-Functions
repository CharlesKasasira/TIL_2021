# First class functions

First-class functions are a programming language feature where functions are treated as values that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. 
In other words, first-class functions can be treated like any other data type such as integers, strings, or arrays.

Languages that support first-class functions allow for functional programming paradigms, where functions can be used to compose and manipulate programs in powerful ways. For example, higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values) can be used to create generic, reusable code that can operate on different data types or implement complex algorithms.

Some examples of programming languages that support first-class functions include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Scheme.
