Disclaimer: Incase the dummy part in the title didn't make it clear, here is a brief of how dummy I am about the subject. I am a software engineer mostly work on the frontend and at the time of writing this( I have been learning and practising web dev for 2years and 10months atleast that's when I joined stackoverflow). I am a second year student of Computer Science and worst of all my favorite character in HBO's Silicon Valley was Nelson "Big Head" Bighetti played by Josh Brener.

#### WTF is a mixer and why is it all over the source
The first word i could see in the twitter algorithm github was mixer, that's mostly because I look at the images first. This got me thinking what is a mixer and then I started counting the number of times I saw the word mixer in the README file
